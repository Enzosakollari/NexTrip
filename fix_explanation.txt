# Autowired Annotation Issue Explanation

## The Problem
In the `EmailService.java` file, there was an issue with the `@Autowired` annotation. The class had:

```java
public class EmailService {
    @Autowired
    private JavaMailSender mailSender;
    
    @Value("${spring.mail.username}")
    private String from;
    
    // methods...
}
```

The problem was that the `EmailService` class was missing a Spring stereotype annotation (like `@Service`, `@Component`, etc.). 

## Why This Is a Mistake
The `@Autowired` annotation is used for dependency injection in Spring, but it only works on beans that are managed by the Spring container. Without a stereotype annotation like `@Service`, Spring doesn't recognize `EmailService` as a bean to manage, so:

1. Spring doesn't create an instance of `EmailService`
2. The `@Autowired` annotation on `mailSender` doesn't work because dependency injection only happens on Spring-managed beans
3. The `@Value` annotation also doesn't work for the same reason

This would likely cause a `NullPointerException` when trying to use `mailSender` because it would never be initialized.

## The Solution
Adding the `@Service` annotation to the class:

```java
@Service
public class EmailService {
    @Autowired
    private JavaMailSender mailSender;
    
    // rest of the code...
}
```

This tells Spring to:
1. Create an instance of `EmailService` as a bean
2. Manage its lifecycle
3. Process the `@Autowired` annotation and inject the `JavaMailSender` bean
4. Process the `@Value` annotation and inject the value from application.properties

## Best Practices
1. Always add an appropriate stereotype annotation (`@Service`, `@Component`, `@Controller`, `@Repository`) to classes that use Spring features like `@Autowired` or `@Value`
2. Consider using constructor injection instead of field injection for better testability
3. Make sure all required dependencies are properly configured in your Spring application context
